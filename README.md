## Dataset
### GSE65682
The GSE65682 dataset, generated by the MARS (Molecular Diagnosis and
Risk Stratification of Sepsis) consortium, includes genome-wide blood transcriptional profiles from critically ill patients. The study primarily focuses on differentiating Sepsis endotypes, analyzing gene expression patterns associated with
various infection sources such as abdominal infections and pneumonia (Scicluna
et al., 2015).
